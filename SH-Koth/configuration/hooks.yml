# You can enable/disable support for each plugin and set their priority.
# The priority is used when more than one plugin is detected, the one with the highest priority will be used.
# If two or more plugins have the same priority, the one that appears first
# Also know that SH-Koth owns a Team system, so if no plugin is detected or enabled, it will use its own system.
